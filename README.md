#################### Shell script project : Hyrule Castle ####################

A command line turn based game in shell script inspired of the Zelda Universe. Each turn the program asks you to choose an action (attack, heal or run) to use against an enemy while he can only attack. Several features are implemented : each enemy has his own parameters (HP ans stength), link can use potions to heal, HP are represented by a dynamic life bar and numerically, allies and enemies actions and parameters are displayed in different colors. The first nine turns link fights against basic bokobkin and then against Ganon in the last turn.
